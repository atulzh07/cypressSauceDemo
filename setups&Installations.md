# Setup Steps

These are the steps to set up Cypress for end-to-end browser automation testing:

1. **Initialize your project**: Start by initializing your project using the following command to create a `package.json` file with project details:

```
npm init
```

2. **Install Cypress**: Install Cypress as a development dependency with the following command:

```
npm install cypress --save-dev
```

3. **Add scripts to package.json**: Add the following scripts to your `package.json` file to make it easier to run Cypress tests:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node_modules/.bin/cypress open",
  "test": "node_modules/.bin/cypress run"
}
```

4. **Launch Cypress**: Start the Cypress Test Runner by running the following command in the terminal:
```
npm run start
```

5. **Select test type**: Within the Cypress Test Runner, select "E2E Testing" for end-to-end browser automation tests.

## Configuration and File Setup

Cypress will automatically create a `cypress.config.js` file along with other necessary files like fixtures and support files. You can customize these files to suit your project's requirements.

With these steps, you've successfully set up Cypress for automated end-to-end testing in your project. You can now start writing your test cases and using Cypress to interact with your web application.
